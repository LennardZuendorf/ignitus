<h1>Welcome at Ingnitr.</h1>
<h2>This is...</h2>
- A simple website to showcase my projects. It's small, but it does the trick, at least for now.
- Who am I? - I'm [Lennard](https://zuendorf.me), a business computing student, hobby dev and music geek.
- I'm currently working on a few projects, which I showcase here (head over there, you can find it up top!).

My projects focus on **Java and Python**, my two main programming languages. Some projects are shown here, some are not and a few ones are in progress right now. Two of my most visible projects I created in Flutter, using [FlutterFlow](https://flutterflow.io/). 
At HTW Berlin I learned all the basis of software engineering and programming in Java, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. The program covers all general topics of software engineering and what you could prob best describe about technology business.

I also have a passion for the **product and business side of technology**, which I got to know extensively over 3 years as working student and intern. All this time I spent at Hypoport SE, in Product Strategy and Innovation Management.

<h4>Mostly I just enjoy trying out things </h4> 
And working myself into new topics a lot and I guess you can kinda see that in all my projects aswell. A negative minded person would probably say I lack focus.
