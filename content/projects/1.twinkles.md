- It's an idea for actually location based, real-time dating. Without everything that's wrong about current apps.
- Build in Flutter and on Firebase, with the help of [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io) and a lot of custom code.

<h4>About the Project</h4>

The idea to create this dating app came together with 3 former colleagues of mine. We all saw a great opportunity in the dating space and some common problems we all agreed on. So we set out to build and MVP for twinkles.

This has been in development a while, but we are still waiting on some important features to be released for the Flutter Google Maps Implementation. Until then, this is a great showcase for the power of low-code and Flutter, since it's 100% build with Flutterflow (including many custom functions by me) and powered by Firebase.
The mockups represent actual looks of the app and are not just for show (the pictures are though, credits below!).
