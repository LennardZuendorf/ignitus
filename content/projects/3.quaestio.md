<h4>About the Project</h4>

The idea to create this dating app came together with 3 former colleagues of mine. We all saw a great opportunity in the dating space and some common problems we all agreed on. So we set out to build and MVP for twinkles.

This has been in development a while, but we are still waiting on some important features to be released for the Flutter Google Maps Implementation. Until then, this is a great showcase for the power of low-code and Flutter, since it's 100% build with Flutterflow (including many custom functions by me) and powered by Firebase.
