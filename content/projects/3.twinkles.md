#description
- It's an idea for real **location-based, real-time dating**. Without everything that's wrong about current apps.
- Build in Flutter and on Firebase, with the help of [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io) and a lot of custom code.
- Check out the official **[website](https://twinkles.rocks)** for more information.

<h4>About the Project</h4>

The idea to create this dating app came together with **3 former colleagues of min**e. We all saw a great opportunity in the dating space and some common problems we all agreed on. So we set out to **build and MVP for twinkles**.

This has been in development a while, but we are still waiting on some important features to be released for the Flutter Google Maps Implementation. Until then, this is a great showcase for the power of **low-code and Flutter**, since it's 100% built with **Flutterflow** (including many custom functions by me) and powered by Firebase.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show (the pictures are though, credits below!).

<h4>Technology</h4>

The App syncs a location every minute (also in the background), unless deactivated. Users get shown based on geohashing in a distance of 10m and their preferences (gender, age, sexuality). Then they can like each other.

Additionally, the app generates a Heatmap based on anonymized historical data; that shows each user where they are most likely to find a match. This is a great way to find out where to go to meet new people.
