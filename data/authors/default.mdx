## Hi, I'm Lennard
**I'm a Business Computing Student at Berlin University of Applied Science for Business and Technology.**

### Who I am

- I'm a **product enthusiast** and hobby **software engineer** working on numerous projects in my free time.
- I seek to shape **impactful products & businesses** at the intersection of **innovation, tech, & business**.
- and I'm a **Music and Podcast nerd**, who spends way too much of his time listening to both.

### What I work on

- Projects that are fun, interesting and new to me. As well as some skill showcases/training projects.
- Mostly, that's in **Python and Java,** but I also have a proper understanding of Javascript, R, HTML/CSS, ...
- Currently, my biggest focus is **Data Engineering and Machine Learning**, since I write my **Thesis about XAI and Transformer Models**

### Work & Studies

- I'm in my 9th semester, first studying Business Law and then Business Computing in Berlin and (for one semester) in Oslo.
- Other than developing, I'm very passionate about the **product and business side of technology**.
- Especially in **FinTech and InsurTech**, which I got to know over 3 years at [Hypoport](hypoport.de), see more below!
