- Nubes is a python based wordle solver,
- it utalises pynecone, which generates react components for the frontend.
- But it's 100% build in Python, running in a container on Digital Ocean.


### About the Project

Nubes is a python showcase/training project for some basic python skills. I (still) do the wordle every day and wanted to build a little solver for it. Moving forward I will try to develop it into more of a helper/something similar to the NY Times Wordle Bot.
