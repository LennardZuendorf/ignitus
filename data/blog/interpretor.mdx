- end to end court case outcome prediction from facts ("sachverhalt") to tenor hosted on huggingface
- using heavily processed German court case from OpenLegalData.io
- **currently WIP**

### About the Project
Legalis is a University project for a machine learning and data science course. I wrote a paper at the University of Oslo about court case outcome prediction and this in the continuation of the project.

I'm using bulk data from [openlegaldata](https:\\openlegaldata.io), which included about 250.000 cases, out of which ca. 38k are usable for me.

### Technology & Tools
I very much enjoy all the features ðŸ¤— huggingface provides and heavily rely on it in my machine learning projects. Especially the hosting of Dataset, Model and App. Additionally, I will use sckit-learn and the ChatGPT API.

ChatGPT works great for the extraction of certain information from longer text (if you're willing to pay or have short texts). I planned to use it for processing 30tsd cases but that is quite pricey.

### Working Steps
I had to do extensive preprocessing and cleaning of the data since the json dumps only provide the entire text in html format. After lots of work and cleaning I was able to extract 2800 cases to include a tenor (summary), reasoning and facts.

This I will use to train to extract a binary ruling with ChatGPT and then train a sckit model to predict the outcome. We'll see about the accuracy of that.
