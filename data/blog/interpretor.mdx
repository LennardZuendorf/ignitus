### About the Project
Legalis is a University project for a machine learning and data science course. I wrote a paper at the University of Oslo about court case outcome prediction and this in the continuation of the project.

I'm using bulk data from [openlegaldata](https:\\openlegaldata.io), which included about 250.000 cases, out of which ca. 38k are usable for me.
