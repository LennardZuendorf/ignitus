- what started as a university project is now my **training project** for java and spring boot

### About the Project

habitus it meant to be the **training ground** for **modern Java** and especially **Spring Boot features**. It's also utilising **Lombok annotations**, which are extremely useful. And I will add quarkus as well, to create a unified Java training ground for both Frameworks.

Feature Roadmap includes the move to a **multimodule project**, hosting on Digital Ocean with Docker and potentially the implementation into a larger scale project called Unitum.
