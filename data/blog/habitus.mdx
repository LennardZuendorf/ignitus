# habitus

- what started as a university project is now my **training project** for java and spring boot
- habitus is the **backend for a habit tracking application**, I might use it in another project
- check out the [Github Repo](https://github.com/LennardZuendorf/habitus/)

### About the Project

habitus it meant to be the **training ground** for **modern Java** and especially **Spring Boot features**. It's also utilising **Lombok annotations**, which are extremely useful. In the future I will try to get it to use the **Supabase GoTrue Server** and add some more neat features as well as goal tracking.

Afterward, I might use it in **another project** idea I have. This one is called **Unitum**, but I am not sure yet if I will build it. Or I will do a **complete switch to Kotlin**.
