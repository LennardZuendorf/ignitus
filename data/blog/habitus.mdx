- what started as a university project is now my **training project** for java and spring boot

### About the Project

habitus it meant to be the **training ground** for **modern Java** and especially **Spring Boot features**. It's also utilising **Lombok annotations**, which are extremely useful.

In the future this will be moved to run on **Google Cloud Platform** and utilise Firebase as Authentication Server. I'll also add some more nice features over time.
