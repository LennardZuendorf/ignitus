summary: 'Showcase for a Java Spring backend, born out of a University Project. Personal training ground.'
github: https://github.com/lennardzuendorf/habitus

- what started as a university project is now my **training project** for java, spring boot and quarkus
- habitus is the **backend for a habit tracking application**, I might use it in another project
- **always WIP**

### About the Project

habitus it meant to be the **training ground** for **modern Java** and especially **Spring Boot features**. It's also utilising **Lombok annotations**, which are extremely useful. And I will add quarkus as well, to create a unified Java training ground for both Frameworks.

Feature Roadmap includes the move to a **multimodule project**, hosting on Digital Ocean with Docker and potentially the implementation into a larger scale project called Unitum.

### Technology

Throughout university, we learned a lot of java. I want to pour all of that into this project, but currently my skills are actually a bit underrepresented.

Habitus is 100% build in Java, with Gradle and Spring Boot. It's also using Lombok and some other dependencies. Although currently running as one project, I will move it to a multi-module project and also include quarkus plus potentially some caching with redis or other technology.
