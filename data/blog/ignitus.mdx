### About the Project

As some of my project are not well represented only on GitHub (i.e. Quaesto, Twinkles or my ML projects), I needed a portfolio website. After lots of trying, building and searching I came up with this. Because can you really have a wix website when you develop?
I'm already working on the next version, which will merge my [personal website/landing](zuendorf.me) page with my portfolio page and add lots of fun features with two or more different style options as well as a switch to typescript.

### Technology
Next.js, in my opinion, has a superior developer experience and performance. And tailwind is simply amazing, because the less CSS the better. Style-wise I got a ton of inspiration from other users of the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog and some research I have done over time.

### Why Ignitr?

My lastname is Zündorf, which is a city/village near Cologne. But "Zünd" or "zünden" also basically can be translated to ignite. Add something in the area of "I like to ignite ideas" and you got ignitr. Plus blue flames or yellow flames which you'll find in the color scheme of this website.
