- quaestio is a game about deep questions to play with friends, your partner or by yourself.

- Build in Flutter and on Firebase, with the help of [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io) and a lot of custom code.

### About the Project

The idea for quaestio has been on my mind for a while. And when I was testing out Flutterflow, I decided to give it a try and see if I could build a prototype in a few days. I was able to build a working prototype in a few days and decided to continue working on it.

I'm currently working on some custom code function and the proper backend/Backen-as-a-Service integration. Also, I'm coming up with additional features for logged-in users.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show.
