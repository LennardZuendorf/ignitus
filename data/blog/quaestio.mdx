summary: 'A beautifully designed game about deep questions. Build on Flutter with FlutterFlow. Still in Development.'
---
- quaestio is a game about deep questions to play with friends, your partner or by yourself.
- You can choose a variety of question categories or mix your own, in the future custom questions will be possible as well.
- Build in Flutter and on Firebase, with the help of [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io) and a lot of custom code.

### About the Project

The idea for quaestio has been on my mind for a while. And when I was testing out Flutterflow, I decided to give it a try and see if I could build a prototype in a few days. That went really well, so I decided to stick with it.

Quaestio allows you to play alone or together with several people (a mode with names is planned). Afer selection a category or creating a mix you will get served questions you can either answer in a group or reflect on yourself. In total there are about 750 questions.

### Technology

The project is 100% build on the Flutterflow platform with some custom function build in Dart. It's also utilising Firebase for Auth, Database, Logging, etc.

I'm currently working on some custom code function and the proper backend/Backen-as-a-Service integration. Also, I'm coming up with additional features for logged-in users.

The mockups represent the actual look and feel of the app and aren't just for show.
